# Stupid Python

Implementation of "Stupide Vautour" and artificial players.

The project is divided in several parts:

- `implementation/game.py` defines the game rules and flow, an example of its use is given at the end of the file
- `implementation/player.py` defines the players that can be used to play the game
- `implementation/analyse.py` contains several functions to process the results of the games played
